# FYP-Project-DTS
My name is Muhammmad Umair Ali and my team members are Rani Faiza, Sobia Ashraf and Ghulam Shabir.Currently, we are doing our BS from University Of Sargodha. We were asked to develop our Final Year Project. Keeping the recently disasters situation in our mind, we guys decided to develop a webapp that will help the donors to easily donate theirs donation to the beneficiaries. The project aim to provide a platform facilitate access to each other by NGOs as well as donors. A donor can donate leftovers, items, money and other necessities for needy people around the country. And by tracking the donation it will alsobe known who got the donationhas been made.
